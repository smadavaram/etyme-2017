## Several agents at once

Seven specialists own disjoint parts of the codebase and work at the same
time; two more read only. `docs/how-agents-work.md` is the working
agreement; `.claude/agents/` holds the definitions.

**Parallelism is bought with a boundary, not with coordination.**
`src/lib/domains.ts` maps every file to exactly one owner and
`__tests__/invariants/domain-ownership.test.ts` fails when a new file has
none or two. A page describing who owns what is wrong within a month; a
test is wrong for exactly one commit.

`prisma/schema.prisma` belongs to nobody. Every domain wants a column in
the same file and it is the one artefact where two individually correct
changes still produce a wrong result, so it queues through
`etyme-architect`. A domain agent that needs a column says what it needs
and why, and stops.

| Agent | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `etyme-money` | How a figure is calculated, when it is billed, what somebody is paid |
| `etyme-regulatory` | Anything with a legal consequence |
| `etyme-conversation` | How something is said, to whom, on which channel, how often |
| `etyme-demand` | Between a manager needing somebody and a person being chosen |
| `etyme-supply` | The bench as a business |
| `etyme-market` | Public words, positioning, and moving work between companies without leaking |
| `etyme-architect` | Schema, shared components, decisions crossing two domains |
| `etyme-scout` | "Does this already exist and who owns it" — read only |
| `etyme-release` | Deciding whether it ships — read only |

Work moves: scout → schema → spec as test names → build → release →
preview URL. Different domains may run at the same time. Two agents in
one domain may not, and neither may anything touching the schema
concurrently.

`docs/delivery-matrix.html` carries L1 to L4 with the owning agent per
L2 group. A change to L3 or L4 belongs in the same commit as the code
that caused it.
