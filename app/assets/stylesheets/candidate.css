/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Basic Styles
 * require bootstrap
 *= require font-awesome
 *
 * SmartAdmin Styles : Caution! DO NOT change the order
 *= require smartadmin-production-plugins
 *= require smartadmin-production

 * specific styles this will also ensure you retrain your customization with
 * each SmartAdmin update.
